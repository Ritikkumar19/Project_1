# Caesar Cipher Project

This project implements the Caesar Cipher, one of the simplest and most well-known encryption techniques. The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter in a given plaintext by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. It’s a fundamental concept in cryptography and an excellent starting point for understanding basic encryption techniques.

## Project Overview

### Objective

The main objective of this project is to provide a basic understanding of encryption and decryption using the Caesar Cipher technique. This project enables users to encrypt and decrypt messages with a specified shift, reinforcing concepts such as string manipulation, character encoding, and modular arithmetic.

### Features

- **Encryption**: Convert a plaintext message into an encrypted form using a specified shift.
- **Decryption**: Convert an encrypted message back to its original plaintext form using the same shift.
- **User Interaction**: Simple command-line interface for choosing between encryption, decryption, or quitting the program.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need Python installed on your system.

### Running the Program

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ritikkumar19/caesar-cipher.git
   cd caesar-cipher
   ```

2. **Run the Program**:

   Execute the program with the following command:

   ```bash
   python caesar_cipher.py
   ```

3. **Use the Program**:

   - Choose whether to encrypt or decrypt a message.
   - Input your message and the desired shift value.
   - The program will output the encrypted or decrypted message accordingly.

### Example

- **Plaintext**: `HELLO`
- **Shift**: `3`
- **Encrypted**: `KHOOR`

## Insights and Considerations

As a classic example of substitution ciphers, the Caesar Cipher is integral to understanding the fundamentals of cryptography. Despite its simplicity, it introduces important concepts such as:

- **Modular Arithmetic**: Understanding how characters wrap around using the modulus operation.
- **Character Encoding**: Learning how to manipulate ASCII values.
- **Security**: Observing the limitations and vulnerabilities of simple encryption methods.

### Future Enhancements

While the Caesar Cipher is not secure by modern standards, this project lays the groundwork for more complex cryptographic algorithms. Future enhancements could include:

- Implementing additional ciphers like Vigenère or substitution ciphers.
- Allowing for encryption with both uppercase and lowercase letters in a single loop.
- Creating a GUI for more user-friendly interaction.
- Expanding the project to include frequency analysis for breaking the cipher without knowing the shift.
